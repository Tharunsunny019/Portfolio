                    <h3>Project-1 : NOTES & PASSWORD MANAGER</h3><br>
                    <p>Password managing & note taking are one of the most overlooked virtual activities in today's digital age. Various companies are constantly adding new features to note taking and password management. Have you ever considered building your own note taking and password managing application. So, instead of having and maintaining two different apps in your system, we'll be developing a single app which can perform both of these activities.</p><br>
                    <p>High-Level Approach
                        The first task, once we get the development environment ready, will be to set up Android Studio & Firebase.
                        Once we have everything in place, we can start off with creating the application, which will basically start with the login authentication.
                        Next up is the home page building. In this project, we will be keeping it simple by showing two options i.e Notes & Password .
                        In our project, we wll need to manage three states: Note (to manage notes data), Password (to manage password data), and user (for managing the details of the currently logged in user).
                        For showing all the notes or passwords , we will be using Listviews or recycleviews .
                        Handling our database and authentication needs to be supported and we will be using Firebase for the same. Basically the database will be used to store the login information for the users , but the resource can be used for storing notes and password information as well.
                        Successful implementation of the above requirements will lead to completion of the core implementation of our application. Next up, deploy!</p>

                            <h3>Projects-2 : LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM </h3><br>
                            <p>Management systems mostly use software across all schools and colleges to keep record of data. One such System is Library Management System, which is used to keep record of books present in a library.


                                These Systems comprises of information regarding Books, where we can perform all the operations that are required in an actual system such as CRUD operation, advanced search, book issuing, and also to store the information within files using the process known as Serialization <br>
                                
                                Project Stages
                                The project consists of the following stages:
                                
                                The project will be a typical command line application in Java.
                                We'll be accepting data (book and user details) to be stored.
                                We'll be adding the functionality to retrieve book details.
                                The admin login session will be emulated via the command line.
                                Only during the admin login session can a user be issued a book.
                                All of the data will be stored in encrypted format in text files to escape the initial volatile nature of the application.</p>
